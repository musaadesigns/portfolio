      <p>My parents and I immigrated to from Pakistan to Chicago when I was 5. Fortunately, we left Chicago for the safety of Toronto a year later and I am grateful that we did. The Muslim ban in America and rise of Islamophobia around the world is something that directly concerns my family, both here in Canada and in the States. Consequently, I took on this project as an opportunity to shed some light on Muslims, like my father, the taxi driver, and their daily grind. The only person who knows how hard my father works more than I do is my father himself. Knowing that the media paints hard working Muslims as dangerous individuals, I decided to combat this ideology with mundane, everyday visuals that working class individuals can relate to, non-Muslims included. These visuals juxtaposed against Donald Trump’s Muslim-ban speech show the difference between the daily life of a Muslim in North America and the lives of Muslims that the media leads you to believe.</p>
